# Scheduled Jobs Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the automated jobs (cron jobs) running in the Donation Agent Evaluator Service, specifically tailored for project managers and testers to understand timing, frequencies, and data refresh cycles.

## Overview

The system uses three types of automated jobs to keep project data and social media content up-to-date:

1. **Project Synchronization Jobs** - Updates project metadata from Giveth backend
2. **Twitter Data Fetching Jobs** - Collects recent tweets from project Twitter accounts
3. **Farcaster Data Fetching Jobs** - Collects recent casts from project Farcaster accounts

## Job Scheduling System

### Main Scheduler (Hourly)
- **Frequency**: Every hour at minute 0 (`:00`)
- **Purpose**: Creates individual jobs for all projects with social media handles
- **Distribution**: Jobs are distributed across the hour (60 minutes) to manage rate limits
- **Jitter**: Random 0-30 second delay added to prevent simultaneous execution

### Job Processor (Every 10 Minutes)
- **Frequency**: Every 10 minutes (`:00`, `:10`, `:20`, `:30`, `:40`, `:50`)
- **Batch Size**: Processes up to 50 jobs per cycle
- **Purpose**: Executes the jobs created by the scheduler

## Detailed Job Information

### 1. Project Synchronization Jobs

#### Timing
- **Creation**: Every 6 hours at minute 0 (`0 */6 * * *`)
- **Schedule**: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC daily
- **Processing**: Immediate execution (not distributed)

#### What It Does
- Fetches all project data from Giveth Impact-Graph API
- Updates project metadata including:
  - Project titles, descriptions, and status
  - Quality scores and GIVpower rankings
  - Social media handles (Twitter/Farcaster URLs)
  - Last update information and content
  - Financial metrics (total donations)
- Ensures local database stays synchronized with Giveth backend

#### Expected Duration
- **Processing Time**: 2-8 minutes depending on total projects (improved with batch processing)
- **Batch Processing**: 15 projects per batch with sequential processing within each transaction
- **Concurrent Operations**: Up to 3 batches processed simultaneously using p-limit
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses isolated batch transactions with sequential project processing for maximum reliability

#### For PM/Testers
- New projects appear in the system within **6 hours** of being added to Giveth
- Project metadata changes reflect within **6 hours**
- Social media handle updates take effect within **6 hours**

### 2. Twitter Data Fetching Jobs

#### Timing
- **Job Creation**: Every hour at minute 0
- **Job Execution**: Distributed across 60 minutes with 0-30s jitter
- **Processing Cycle**: Every 10 minutes (up to 50 jobs per cycle)

#### Rate Limiting
- **Between Jobs**: 4-8 second delays between Twitter requests
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1min, 2min, 4min)
- **API Limits**: Respects Twitter's rate limiting automatically

#### What It Does
- Fetches recent tweets for projects with Twitter handles
- **Incremental Fetching**: Only gets new tweets since last fetch
- Stores tweet content, timestamps, and metadata
- Updates project's last fetch timestamp
- Stops automatically when duplicate tweets are detected

#### Expected Data Freshness
- **New Tweets**: Appear within **70 minutes** of posting (worst case)
- **Project Coverage**: All projects with Twitter handles processed every hour
- **Data Completeness**: Incremental approach ensures no tweets are missed

#### For PM/Testers
- Twitter content used in evaluations is **maximum 70 minutes old**
- Failed fetches are automatically retried up to 3 times
- Projects without recent activity won't generate unnecessary API calls

### 3. Farcaster Data Fetching Jobs

#### Timing
- **Job Creation**: Every hour at minute 0
- **Job Execution**: Distributed across 60 minutes with 0-30s jitter
- **Processing Cycle**: Every 10 minutes (up to 50 jobs per cycle)

#### Rate Limiting
- **Between Jobs**: 2-3 second delays between Farcaster requests
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1min, 2min, 4min)
- **API Cost**: Completely FREE (uses FName Registry + Warpcast APIs)

#### What It Does
- Resolves Farcaster usernames to Farcaster IDs (FIDs)
- Fetches recent casts for projects with Farcaster usernames
- **Incremental Fetching**: Only gets new casts since last fetch
- Stores cast content, timestamps, and metadata
- Updates project's last fetch timestamp

#### Expected Data Freshness
- **New Casts**: Appear within **70 minutes** of posting (worst case)
- **Project Coverage**: All projects with Farcaster handles processed every hour
- **Username Handling**: Properly handles username transfers and ownership changes

#### For PM/Testers
- Farcaster content used in evaluations is **maximum 70 minutes old**
- No API costs or limits concerns (completely free APIs)
- Robust handling of Farcaster protocol complexities

## Data Refresh Timeline Summary

| Data Type | Maximum Age | Update Frequency | Processing Window |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Project Metadata | 6 hours | Every 6 hours | 2-8 minutes (improved) |
| Twitter Content | 70 minutes | Every hour | Distributed over 60 minutes |
| Farcaster Content | 70 minutes | Every hour | Distributed over 60 minutes |

## Job Status and Monitoring

### Job Statuses
- **PENDING**: Job created and waiting to be processed
- **PROCESSING**: Job currently being executed
- **COMPLETED**: Job finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Job failed after all retry attempts

### Retry Logic
- **Maximum Retries**: 3 attempts per job
- **Backoff Strategy**: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes
- **Failure Handling**: Jobs marked as FAILED after 3 failed attempts

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Individual job failures don't stop the entire system
- **Batch Isolation**: Failed batches don't affect other concurrent batches
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic pause after 5 consecutive batch failures prevents system overload
- **Transaction Recovery**: Automatic query runner health monitoring and recovery
- **Detailed Logging**: All activities logged with correlation IDs for troubleshooting
- **Metadata Tracking**: Job results stored with processing times and error details

## Performance Characteristics

### Twitter Jobs
- **Processing Time**: 2-8 seconds per project (average 4 seconds)
- **Success Rate**: >95% under normal conditions
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic delays prevent API throttling

### Farcaster Jobs
- **Processing Time**: 1-3 seconds per project (average 2 seconds)
- **Success Rate**: >98% (free APIs are very reliable)
- **No Rate Limits**: Free tier has generous limits

### Project Sync Jobs
- **Processing Time**: 2-8 minutes total (improved with concurrent batch processing)
- **Batch Processing**: 15 projects per batch, sequential processing within transactions
- **Concurrency Control**: 3 batches processed concurrently, projects processed sequentially within each batch
- **Success Rate**: >99.5% (enhanced error handling and transaction management)
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker stops processing after 5 consecutive batch failures

## Impact on Evaluations

### Data Availability
- Project evaluations always use data that is **maximum 6 hours old** for project metadata
- Social media evaluations use content that is **maximum 70 minutes old**
- This ensures evaluations reflect current project activity accurately

### Evaluation Triggers
- New project evaluations can be run immediately after project sync (every 6 hours)
- Social media scores reflect recent activity within 70 minutes
- No manual intervention needed for data freshness

## Troubleshooting for Testers

### Expected Delays
- **New Project**: Visible in system within 6 hours
- **New Social Media Handle**: Fetching starts within 6 hours + 70 minutes processing
- **New Content**: Available for evaluation within 70 minutes

### Common Issues
- **Missing Social Media Data**: Check if handles are correctly set in Giveth (updated every 6 hours)
- **Stale Content**: Verify project has recent activity; system stops fetching duplicates
- **Evaluation Inconsistencies**: Data is refreshed on different schedules; wait for next sync cycle

### Manual Triggers (Admin Only)
- Project sync can be manually triggered via admin endpoints
- Individual job processing can be manually executed
- Statistics and job status available via monitoring endpoints

- System scales automatically with number of projects
- **Enhanced reliability** with batch processing and circuit breaker protection
- **Faster processing** with optimized concurrent operations
- Rate limits are respected to ensure stable operation
