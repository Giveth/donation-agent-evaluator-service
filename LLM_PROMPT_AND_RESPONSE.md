## LLM Response

```json
{
  "projectInfoQualityScore": 40,
  "socialMediaQualityScore": 0,
  "twitterQualityScore": 0,
  "farcasterQualityScore": 0,
  "relevanceToCauseScore": 20,
  "twitterRelevanceScore": 0,
  "farcasterRelevanceScore": 0,
  "projectRelevanceScore": 20,
  "evidenceOfImpactScore": 0,
  "projectInfoQualityReasoning": "The project description is very generic and lacks specific details about 'Giveth' beyond being a transparent giving platform. There's no recent update, which significantly impacts the score for completeness and transparency.",
  "socialMediaQualityReasoning": "There is no recent social media activity on either Twitter or Farcaster, resulting in a score of 0.",
  "relevanceToCauseReasoning": "The project 'Giveth' is described as a general giving platform. While it could theoretically be used for rainforest causes, there is no specific mention or indication that it is tailored to or actively supports 'Saving the Rainforest'. Its relevance is purely theoretical and not demonstrated.",
  "evidenceOfImpactReasoning": "There is no evidence of impact provided in the project description, updates, or social media. The description focuses on the platform's features (transparency) rather than specific outcomes or beneficiaries. The lack of recent updates and social media activity further contributes to a score of 0."
}
```

## Final Score Calculation

### Platform-Specific Calculations:
- **Social Media Quality**: Twitter (0) × 50% + Farcaster (0) × 50% = 0
- **Relevance to Cause**: Twitter (0) × 33% + Farcaster (0) × 33% + Project (20) × 34% = 7 (rounded)

### Weighted Final Score:
- **Project Info Quality**: 40 × 15% = 6.0
- **Update Recency**: 0 × 10% = 0.0
- **Social Media Quality**: 0 × 10% = 0.0
- **Social Media Recency**: 0 × 5% = 0.0
- **Social Media Frequency**: 0 × 5% = 0.0
- **Relevance to Cause**: 7 × 20% = 1.4
- **Evidence of Impact**: 0 × 20% = 0.0
- **GIVpower Rank**: 100 × 15% = 15.0

**Total Cause Score**: 22/100

## Analysis

The LLM evaluation correctly identified:

1. **Project Info Quality (40/100)**: Generic description, no recent updates
2. **Social Media (0/100)**: No activity on either platform
3. **Relevance (20/100)**: Theoretical but not demonstrated connection to rainforest causes
4. **Evidence of Impact (0/100)**: No concrete examples of outcomes or beneficiaries
5. **Platform-specific scoring**: Correctly applied 50/50 Twitter/Farcaster and 33/33/34 relevance weights

The evaluation demonstrates that the PM's new scoring rubric is working correctly, with the **Evidence of Impact** criterion properly integrated and the platform-specific scoring functioning as specified.
